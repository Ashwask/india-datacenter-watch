# India Datacenter Watch

An open, **community-accountability map of data centers across India** — operational, under
construction, proposed, and resident-reported — with a public **source link for every facility**.

Inspired by the [Brockovich Data Center map](https://brockovichdatacenter.com/) for the US, this
project brings the same transparency lens to India's fast-growing data-center footprint and its
**energy, water, e-waste, land, and noise** impacts on local communities.

> India's operational data-center stock crossed **~1,520 MW IT** in 2025 (+34% YoY) and is projected
> to triple by 2030. A WRI India analysis found **more than half of India's data centers sit in
> water-stressed regions**, even as cooling demand is set to rise from ~150 billion litres (2025) to
> ~358 billion by 2030.

The dataset currently tracks **187 facilities** across **45 operators**, **30 cities**, and
**18 states/UTs** — from hyperscale campuses to edge and GPU/AI sites. Every row carries a source.

The site is fully data-driven (Leaflet + Chart.js):

- **Statistics** — live charts: status mix, top operators, cumulative-growth trend, IT load by state.
- **Key Concerns** — each of the six cards is clickable and opens a data modal with **impact
  calculations** (energy, CO₂, water, e-waste, homes-equivalent) and **trend graphs** specific to that
  concern. Estimates are derived transparently from disclosed IT load (PUE 1.6, water 1.8 L/kWh, grid
  0.71 tCO₂/MWh) and labelled as estimates.
- **Sources** — full facility directory table with a Source column, plus **Download CSV** (filtered or
  full dataset).

## Run the map (no server needed)

```bash
# After editing data/datacenters.csv, regenerate the embedded data:
python3 web/build_data.py

# Then just open the page — or serve it for clean local URLs:
cd web && python3 -m http.server 8080
# open http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Run the API (optional)

```bash
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
# open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

Endpoints: `GET /datacenters` (filter by `state`, `city`, `operator`, `status`, `water_stressed`),
`GET /datacenters/{id}`, `GET /stats`, `GET /health`.

## Adding or correcting a facility

1. Add/edit a row in `data/datacenters.csv` (see `data/schema.json` for fields).
2. **Every row must have a real `source` URL.** Use city-centroid coordinates if exact siting isn't
   public, and note that in `notes`.
3. Run `python3 web/build_data.py` to refresh the map data.
4. Open a PR. Community reports submitted via the website are reviewed before being added as
   `community_reported`.

## Data caveats

- Coordinates are placed at city/cluster centroid where exact siting is undisclosed (e.g. cloud
  "regions" and many hyperscale campuses) — the popup says so.
- `it_load_mw` is shown only where a public figure exists.
- `water_stressed` is a **watch flag** for regions identified as water-stressed (e.g. WRI India),
  not a measured per-facility figure.
- Smaller captive, edge, and unannounced facilities may still be missing. Corrections welcome.
